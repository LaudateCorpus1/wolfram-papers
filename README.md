* Title: Creating and Transforming a Second-Rank Antisymmetric Field- Strength Tensor Fαβ in Minkowski Space using MATHEMATICA
* Author(s): Kim, Bogyeong; Yun, Hee-Joong

* Abstract:

As the laws of physics are expressed in a manner that makes their invariance under coordinate transformations manifest, they should be written in terms of tensors. Furthermore, tensors make manifest the characteristics and behaviors of electromagnetic fields through inhomogeneous, anisotropic, and compressible media. Electromagnetic fields are expressed completely in tensor form, Fαβ, which implies both electric field E → and magnetic field B → rather than separately in the vector fields. This study presents the Mathematica platform that generates and transforms a second-rank antisymmetric field-strength tensor Fαβ and whiskbroom pattern in Minkowski space. The platforms enhance the capabilities of students and researchers in tensor analysis and improves comprehension of the elegant features of complete structure in physics.

* Title: New traveling wave solutions for the higher Sharma-Tasso-Olver equation by using extension exponential rational function method
* Author(s): El-Rashidy, K.
* Publication: Volume 17, article id. 103066
* Article: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ResPh..1703066E/abstract
* Abstract:

A new and general wave traveling solutions for Sharma-Tasso-Olver and (2 + 1)-dimensional Sharma-Tasso-Olver equation are deduced by using the extension exponential rational function method. The solution's graphics described the physical phenomena of the Sharma-Tasso-Olver dynamical system. The Wolfram Mathematica program used to compute the solutions and the graphics plots in this study.
